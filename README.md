# Pub
Pub is a general-purpose publication contract for the Ethereum Network.

## Why Use Pub
Pub is the cheapest censorship-resistant publication platform available.
There are no profiteers, including yourself and the developers.
All published content is freely available to everyone for the duration of the Ethereum Network.
Pub is immutable.
Pub is forever.

## How to Use Pub
### Use Mist.
Install mist from Github.
Mist is an open-source Dapp browser specialized for Ethereum.

### Obtain a key
Generate a key for the Ethereum Network.
In Pub as in Ethereum, your public key is your identity.
Please follow all of the best practices to protect your private key.
If you intend to remain anonymous, you may consider generating a new key for every publication.

### Obtain ether.
Ether is required to pay the cost of every node in the Ethereum Network permanently hosting your content.
The easiest and most common way to obtain ether is through a currency exchange.
The more bytes in your publication, the more ether you will need.

### Locate Pub
In Mist, go to Contracts > Watch Contract.
Pub is currently located at `0x80d9b122Dc3a16FdC41f96cF010FFE7e38d227C3`.
The ABI is:

```
[{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"},{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"allByAuthor","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"all","outputs":[{"name":"source","type":"address"},{"name":"title","type":"string"},{"name":"body","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"_name","type":"string"}],"name":"sign","outputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"size","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"_author","type":"address"}],"name":"publicationCount","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"address"}],"name":"authors","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"_title","type":"string"},{"name":"_body","type":"string"}],"name":"publish","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"}]
```

### Execute publish()
Be sure to provide enough gas.
Gas cost is calculable, but not yet automatically calculated.
Verify there is no cheaper format for your content.
Verify there are no errors in your content.
You will not be able to edit or update your publication.

## Contributing
Optimizations that reduce the cost of publication are welcome. Please create a pull request on Github.

Augmentations to the feature set, such as comments, tagging, and tipping, are best implemented as standalone contracts that reference the Pub.
